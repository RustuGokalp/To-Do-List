# To Do List
- I made the To Do List project, which is a must-have project for someone who is starting to develop a Frontend using JavaScript.
- While I was doing the To Do List project, which was given as the 2nd project homework in Patika, which I had a lot of fun and research, I enjoyed learning new things as a result of my research on JavaScript. 
- I have shared a screenshot of my project below with you. 
- Thank you for your interest.
